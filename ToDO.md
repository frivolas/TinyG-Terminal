# To Do list
- Add functionality to reconnect serial
- Add list of basic commands to the right of the terminal (!%, $comm:val, etc) or maybe on pop-up window?
- Improve the serial comm methods, current while(serial.available()>0) hijacks the thread, so everything needs to live inside of it.
- Figure out how to improve the memory usage of the textArea
- Update the README. Maybe write a Wiki
